The homepage for my projects I made.

This project was made to make life easier for me on github. You see I am a scratcher (it means a member that has some requirements on scratch.mit.edu),
and I don't want people to look inside my code or remix it (clone it and modify it). In the past I converted my projects to html and created repositries for them,
but it takes a while. So I made this project. You go into the projects folder, create a new folder with the project name and put the files in there.
Then github will just get the website ready again and we can type in [name] and it will redirect you to https://victor-gerhard-wolmarans/home/projects/name/index
